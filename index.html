      <h1>Info om dette prosjektet</h1>
      <p> Out of United Nations Sustainability Goals, clean water is a recurring theme.
      It is especially present in goal nr. 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, and also in goal nr. 14: Life below water.<br>
      A problem seems to be human pollution and poor filtration giving contaminated water.<br>
      A method that can fix several problems regarding reaching these two goals is to improve filtration of the water.<br>
      This goes for unclean water that has gone through minimal filtration before it is dumped back into the ocean, and sometimes back into water sources meant for human consumption.<br>
      The goal of this website is to highlight the importance of filtrating unclean water, and its importance for environmental and human health.<br>
