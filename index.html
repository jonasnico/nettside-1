      <h1>Info om dette prosjektet</h1>
      <p> Out of United Nations Sustainability Goals, clean water is a recurring theme.
      It is especially present in goal nr. 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, and also in goal nr. 14: Life below water.<br>
      A problem seems to be human pollution and poor filtration giving contaminated water.<br>
      A method that can fix several problems regarding reaching these two goals is to improve filtration of the water.<br>
      This goes for unclean water that has gone through minimal filtration before it is dumped back into the ocean, and sometimes back into water sources meant for human consumption.<br>
      The goal of this website is to highlight the importance of filtrating unclean water, and its importance for environmental and human health.<br>

  <p>Water is a fundamental human need. Each person on Earth requires at least 20 to 50 liters of clean,
    safe water a day for drinking, cooking, and simply keeping themselves clean.</p>

  <p>Globally, at least 2 billion people use a drinking water source contaminated with faeces.
    Contaminated water can transmit diseases such diarrhoea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and polio.
    Contaminated drinking water is estimated to cause 485 000 diarrhoeal deaths each year.</p>

  <p>Safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 requires we invest in adequate infrastructure, provide sanitation facilities, and encourage hygiene.
    Protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems is essential.
    Ensuring universal safe and affordable drinking water involves reaching over 800 million people who lack basic services and improving accessibility and safety of services for over two billion.</p>

  <p>We are seeing a 26 percent rise in ocean acidification since the beginning of the industrial revolution.
    Marine pollution, an overwhelming majority of which comes from land-based sources, is reaching alarming levels,
    with an average of 13,000 pieces of plastic litter to be found on every square kilometre of ocean.</p>
