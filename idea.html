    <h1>
      Our idea is a Water Filtration System
      </h1>
      <p> Out of United Nations Sustainability Goals, clean water is a recurring theme.
      It is especially present in goal nr. 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, and also in goal nr. 14: Life below water.
      A problem seems to be human pollution and poor filtration giving contaminated water.
      A method that can fix several problems regarding reaching these two goals is to improve filtration of the water.
      This goes for unclean water that has gone through minimal filtration before it is dumped back into the ocean, and sometimes back into water sources meant for human consumption.
      The goal of this website is to highlight the importance of filtrating unclean water, and its importance for environmental and human health.
