      <h1>Clean water now!</h1>
      <p> Out of United Nations Sustainability Goals, clean water is a recurring theme.
        <br><br>
      It is especially present in goal nr. 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, and also in goal nr. 14: Life below water.
      <br><br>
      A problem seems to be human pollution and poor filtration giving contaminated water.
      <br><br>
      A method that can fix several problems regarding reaching these two goals is to improve filtration of the water.
      <br><br>
      This goes for unclean water that has gone through minimal filtration before it is dumped back into the ocean, and sometimes back into water sources meant for human consumption.
      <br><br>
      The goal of this website is to highlight the importance of filtrating unclean water, and its importance for environmental and human health.<br><br>
      Clean water is something affecting more than 1/4th of the worlds population. <br><br>

    <h1>Our idea: A more improved water filtration system</h1>
    <p> There is a great need to have more water filtration and to improve the ones that are already installed.
      <br><br>
      Improved water filtration will lead to cleaner water that is better for oceanic health, nature and better for human health overall.
      <br><br>
      Water is the most important thing on the planet that we all need for survival.
      <br><br>
      Of course, water filtration is only part of the solution.
      <br><br>
      Read on to find out more about the importance of water filtration. <br><br>
      We need to fix this issue now!<br>
